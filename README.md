I liked the suggestion in FAQ Section about copying the words in the dictionary on my mac into a words list, but the list was over 700,000
words long, and many of them were, in my opinion, difficult to remember.  Being a fan of Monty Python and Doctor Who, I decided to try using a list of British words.

I found a list on a wikipedia page called [List of British words not widely used in the United States.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States)  I copied the words, removed the definitions, removed all entries that were longer than one word, set the entire list to lower case and saved it as a text file.



## OTHER CREDITS

Having never worked on something this complicated, I was really unsure even where to start.  (kind of like those first college English classes where I stared at the screen, not even knowing how to start writing an essay!)  I spent a lot of time watchng the FAQ section on the P2 Project, and a great deal of my code is heavily influenced by, or in some cases I did base the code  on what was demonstrated in lecture. 

the logic.php page especially is based very heavily on that lecture.
