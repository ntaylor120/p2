I liked the suggestion in FAQ Section about copying the words in the dictionary on my mac into a words list, but the list was over 700,000
words long, and many of them were, in my opinion, difficult to remember.  Being a fan of Monty Python and Doctor Who, I decided to try using a list of British words.

I found a list on a wikipedia page called [List of British words not widely used in the United States.] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_British_words_not_widely_used_in_the_United_States)  I copied the words, removed the definitions, removed all entries that were longer than one word, set the entire list to lower case and saved it as a text file.
